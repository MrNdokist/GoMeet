# Go&Meet

* This project is essentially a social/recreational application which gives information of all the events (public/private) happening in the local vicinity of the user on a real-time basis. The users can then navigate to any event using the in-app map. 
* An event can be created by any user and can be made visible to all the other users in the vicinity. 
* The application uses the user's location on logging into the main activity, and shows all the events near the user's location. The user can then choose the event to which he/she wants to go to, and navigate to that event using the maps.

## Use of Open Data in this Project

All the open data used in this project is from the official [Boston City Government Website](https://data.boston.gov). The following data sets are stored in the database-
 - [Boston Crime Data Since 2015](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system)
 - [Boston Neighborhood](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhoods)
 - [Boston Free WiFi Locations](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/wicked-free-wi-fi-locations)
 
## How we Built the App

* The app was developed on Android Studio.
* Firebase was used for user authentication and verification.
* Firebase's NoSQL Database was used as the database for this app. We used a NoSQL Database because we wanted a high-perfomance non-relational database which could handle a large amount of data in real-time.
