# Go&Meet

* This project is essentially a social/recreational application which gives information of all the events (public/private) happening in the local vicinity of the user on a real-time basis. The users can then navigate to any event using the in-app map. 
* An event can be created by any user and can be made visible to all the other users in the vicinity. 
* Interested users can also share their GPS in order to meet new people in their locality. Since we do not want the application to be used for sending text messages, but also want to give the users some means to communicate, there are some pre-defined messages which users can send to each other to set up a meet.
