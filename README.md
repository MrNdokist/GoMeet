# Go&Meet

* This project is essentially a social/recreational application which gives information of all the events (public/private) happening in the local vicinity of the user on a real-time basis. The users can then navigate to any event using the in-app map. 
* An event can be created by any user and can be made visible to all the other users in the vicinity. 
* The application uses the user's location on logging into the main activity, and shows all the events near the user's location. The user can then choose the event to which he/she wants to go to, and navigate to that event using the maps.
